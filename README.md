# 🕵️‍♂️ Standup Saboteur

Sneak chaos into your daily standup with a randomly assigned French word you must *somehow* use in your meeting. Will it be “pamplemousse”? “Toboggan”? Only fate knows.

## 🎯 What is this?

A tiny React + TypeScript app that gives you a new "word of the day" challenge every day. Your mission: slip that word into your standup without getting weird looks. Bonus points if nobody notices.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- JSON word list for max sabotage elegance

## 🚀 Try it (Soon)

## 🙃 Disclaimer

This app is meant for fun. If you get fired for saying “cornichon” in front of the VP of Sales, that’s on you.
